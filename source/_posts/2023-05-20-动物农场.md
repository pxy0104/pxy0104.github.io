## 第五章节选

**原文**

At last the day came when Snowball’s plans were completed. At the Meeting on the following Sunday the question of whether or not to begin work on the windmill was to be put to the vote. When the animals had assembled in the big barn, Snowball stood up and, though occasionally interrupted by bleating from the sheep, set forth his reasons for advocating the building of the windmill. Then Napoleon stood up to reply. He said very quietly that the windmill was nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote for it, and promptly sat down again; he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and seemed almost indifferent as to the effect he produced. At this Snowball sprang to his feet, and shouting down the sheep, who had begun bleating again, broke into a passionate appeal in favour of the windmill. Until now the animals had been about equally divided in their sympathies, but in a moment Snowball’s eloquence had carried them away. In glowing sentences he painted a picture of Animal Farm as it might be when sordid labour was lifted from the animals’ backs. His imagination had now run far beyond chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers. Electricity, he said, could operate threshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders, besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and cold water, and an electric heater. By the time he had finished speaking, there was no doubt as to which way the vote would go. But just at this moment Napoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at Snowball, uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before.

At this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous dogs wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn. They dashed straight for Snowball, who only sprang from his place just in time to escape their snapping jaws. In a moment he was out of the door and they were after him. Too amazed and frightened to speak, all the animals crowded through the door to watch the chase. Snowball was racing across the long pasture that led to the road. He was running as only a pig can run, but the dogs were close on his heels. Suddenly he slipped and it seemed certain that they had him. Then he was up again, running faster than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again. One of them all but closed his jaws on Snowball’s tail, but Snowball whisked it free just in time. Then he put on an extra spurt and, with a few inches to spare, slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen no more.

Silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn. In a moment the dogs came bounding back. At first no one had been able to imagine where these creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved: they were the puppies whom Napoleon had taken away from their mothers and reared privately. Though not yet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and as fierce-looking as wolves. They kept close to Napoleon. It was noticed that they wagged their tails to him in the same way as the other dogs had been used to do to Mr. Jones.

Napoleon, with the dogs following him, now mounted on to the raised portion of the floor where Major had previously stood to deliver his speech.He announced that from now on the Sunday-morning Meetings would come to an end. They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time. In future all questions relating to the working of the farm would be settled by a special committee of pigs, presided over by himself. These would meet in private and afterwards communicate their decisions to the others. The animals would still assemble on Sunday mornings to salute the flag,singBeasts of England, and receive their orders for the week; but there would be no more debates.

**译文**

终于到了那一天，雪球把蓝图搞出来了。要不要开始建造风车的问题，将在次日的星期天碰头会上进行表决。动物们在大谷仓里聚集完毕后，雪球站起来发言，虽然间或被绵羊们的咩咩声所打断，他还是摆出了主张造风车的一条条理由。接着是拿破仑站起来提出反对意见。他胸有成竹地说，风车纯属无稽之谈，他奉劝大家不要投赞成票，旋即重又坐下；他的发言仅仅用时30秒，至于效果如何，他好像根本不在乎。雪球一听，立即蹦了起来，他先喝令又咩咩叫起来的绵羊们闭嘴，继而发表一篇充满激情的演说，呼吁与会者投票支持建造风车。此前动物中持赞成和反对态度的数目大致相等，可是转眼间雪球的口才使他们失去了自持。又脏又累的劳动重负从动物背上卸去以后，到那时动物农场将会出现怎样的景象——雪球用神采飞扬的语言描绘的正是这样一幅图画。现在他的想像力已把铡草机、萝卜切片机之类远远甩在后面。他说，电力不但可以让每一个厩栏拥有自己的电力照明、冷热水、电热器，还能够使脱粒机、犁铧、耙子、碾子、收割机、捆草机一一转动起来。到他结束这篇演说的时候，投票的走势已经不存在什么悬念了。但就在这个当口儿，拿破仑站起身来，斜对着雪球瞄了他异乎寻常的一眼，随后发出一声调门极高的嚎叫，以前任谁也从未听到过他发出这样的嚎叫。

会场外面顿时响起一片价惊心动魄的狺狺狂吠声。九条戴着铜钉颈套的庞然大狗向谷仓里冲了进来。他们朝雪球直扑过去，后者全靠及时纵身一跃从所处的位置跳开，才逃过那九副铮铮利牙这一劫。刹那间，雪球已到了门外，九条狗立即追上去。动物们愕然不知所措，全都吓得说不出话来，纷纷挤到门外去看这场追逐。雪球正狂奔着穿过那块通大路的长形牧草地。也只有猪才能如此奔跑，但那些狗紧追不舍。突然间，他滑倒了，看来这下肯定要落入九条狗掌中了。然而猪重新爬起来，跑得比任何时候更快，于是狗们又逼得越来越近，其中一条的钳口几乎已经夹住雪球的尾巴，但雪球死命一甩，总算及时挣脱。紧接着，猪倾全力作出惊险绝伦的最后冲刺，就差那么几英寸，终于钻过树篱的一个豁口侥幸脱身，一下子消失得无影无踪。

惊魂未定的动物们爬回到谷仓里，一个个都默不做声。转眼间，那些狗也都连蹦带跳跑了回来。起初，谁也想像不出这九条狗是哪来的，但这一疑团很快就给解开了：那正是拿破仑从他们的母亲那儿带走并秘密私养的九只小狗。尽管尚未完成长足，可已俨然是九条庞然大犬，且凶相十足，像一群恶狼。他们紧挨在拿破仑身边。有动物注意到，他们朝着拿破仑摇尾巴的神态，跟另一些狗过去惯于向琼斯先生做的姿态一个样。

背后跟着这群狗的拿破仑，这会儿登上了往日少校站着发表演说的那个隆起的平台。他宣布，从今往后星期日上午的碰头会不再举行。他说，开这种会毫无必要，纯属浪费时间。今后，有关农场运作的所有问题，将由一个专门委员会做出决定，其成员均为猪，由他亲自担任主席。猪委员们将秘密开会，以后再把他们的决议向其他动物传达。动物们在星期日上午仍将聚集在一起向农场的场旗致敬，唱《英格兰的生灵》，接受下达给他们的一周工作任务；但不再需要加以讨论。

## 第七章节选

可是，理想的动物社会没有盼到，而他们反倒落入了这样一个时代：谁也不敢说出自己的想法，动辄狂吠不止的恶犬到处横行，你不得不眼睁睁看着你的同志在招认了丑恶罪行后被撕成碎片——她不知道怎么会闹成这样的。她头脑里并没有造反或违命的想法。她知道，即使就目前的状况而言，他们的日子仍然比琼斯时代好得多。她也知道，必须阻止人们卷土重来——这比其他一切更重要。不管发生什么事情，她将保持忠诚，努力工作，完成交给她的任务，接受拿破仑的领导。可是，说到底，她和所有别的动物希望看到并为之埋头苦干的，毕竟不是现在这种局面。他们建造风车，横眉冷对琼斯的猎枪子弹，也不是为了过今天这样的日子。这便是她的想法，尽管她缺乏言语把想法表达出来。
